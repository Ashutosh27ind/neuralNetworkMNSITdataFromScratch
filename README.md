# neuralNetworkMNSITdataFromScratch
We will build a complete neural network using Numpy from scratch on MNSIT handwritten digits dataset.

In this assignment, you'll implement an L-layered deep neural network and train it on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains   
scanned images of handwritten digits, along with their correct classification labels (between 0-9). MNIST's name comes from the fact that  
it is a modified subset of two data sets collected by NIST, the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology.  

## Problem Statement  
  
In this assignment, you will build a complete neural network using Numpy. You will implement all the steps required to build a network - 
feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc.  

You will use the MNIST dataset to train your model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.  
 
The assignment is divided into the following sections:  
•	Data preparation
•	Feedforward
•	Loss computation
•	Backpropagation
•	Parameter updates
•	Model training and predictions
